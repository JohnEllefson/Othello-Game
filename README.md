# Overview

This is a 2-player game based on Othello. The objective is to have the majority of pieces on the board by the end of the game (once the board is filled) be your pieces. Player's pieces are represented by the 'x' and 'o' characters respectively. When a piece is placed, if it is placed so that opponent's pieces are "sandwiched" between two of your pieces along a line, then that player "outflanked" the opponent's pieces and they turn into their own pieces. I created this program in Kotlin for the purpose of learning and becoming more familiar with the language.
